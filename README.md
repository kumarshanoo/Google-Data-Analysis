# Cyclistic_Case_Study
This case study is part of my Google Data Analytics Certification. This is one of the 3 problem statements given for the capstone project.

## About the company 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## The Questions
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

At first, I felt tense about how I could answer all these questions, considering that I had just completed the certification and my knowledge was limited. However, I decided to invest some time in reading the objectives and approached the task by starting with some basic questions in my mind. As I progressed, I began to understand that I had all the necessary knowledge to find the answers. I realised that I just needed to connect the little pieces I knew in order to create a method to answer the questions.

## The Data
The Data I’m working on is of First Party Type. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this Licence (https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) The data integrity was checked and deemed unbiased.

This includes data from 2014 but in order to completely make my data ROCCC i.e Reliable, original, comprehensive, current ans cited, I will use data of 2022 from january to december, so i will work in a total of 12 csv files.
